    <h1>Favorite Restaurant</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      It's always difficult to find the best restaurant to go to for a group of
      friends. We will build a solution that chooses the ideal restaurant given
      the friend's preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Build</h2>
    <p>
      For each strategy below write a function that determines the results given
      a hash of friend's names with three preferred restaurants each.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Strategy 1</strong> - Return the most commonly occurring
        restaurant
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strategy 2</strong> - Return the top two most commonly occurring
        options for further consideration
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strategy 3</strong> - Return the winning restaurant with
        consideration of their ranked order in the input. First selection gets 3
        points, next is 2 points, last is 1 point.
      </li>
    </ul>
